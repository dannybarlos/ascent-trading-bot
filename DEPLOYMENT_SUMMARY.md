## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Easiest)

**One command deploys everything:**
```bash
./deploy-railway.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Installs Railway CLI (if needed)
2. ✅ Logs you into Railway
3. ✅ Creates and configures project
4. ✅ Adds Redis plugin automatically
5. ✅ Prompts for Alpaca credentials
6. ✅ Sets all environment variables
7. ✅ Deploys your app
8. ✅ Opens dashboard

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Cost:** Free for 500 hours/month, then $5/month
**Always On:** Yes (on paid plan)

---

### Option 2: Render.com (Good Free Tier)

**Deploy from GitHub with one click:**
1. Push to GitHub
2. Click "Deploy to Render" button
3. Set Alpaca credentials
4. Deploy

---

### Option 3: Fly.io (Best for Production)

**Deploy with Fly CLI:**
```bash
flyctl launch
flyctl secrets set ALPACA_API_KEY=xxx

## 🏃 Quick Start Paths

### Path 1: Just Want It Running Fast
```bash
./deploy-railway.sh
```
→ Follow prompts, done in 5 minutes

### Path 2: Want It Free Forever
1. Deploy frontend to Vercel
2. Deploy backend to Render
3. Configure API URL
→ See `HOSTING.md` for details

### Path 3: Self-Hosted
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Alpaca keys
docker-compose up -d
```
→ Running on http://localhost:8000

### Path 4: Production-Grade
```bash
flyctl launch
flyctl secrets set ALPACA_API_KEY=xxx
flyctl secrets set ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=xxx
flyctl deploy
```
→ Global edge network, auto-scaling

## 🔐 Security Features

All deployment methods include:
- ✅ Secrets never in code
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS by default
- ✅ Non-root containers
- ✅ Automatic updates
- ✅ Health monitoring

---

## 📈 What Happens After Deployment

### Automatic
1. ✅ Frontend builds and compiles
2. ✅ Backend starts with multiple workers
3. ✅ Redis connects (if available)
4. ✅ Health checks begin
5. ✅ HTTPS certificate provisioned
6. ✅ Custom domain ready (optional)

### Manual (One-Time)
1. ⚙️ Get Alpaca API credentials
2. ⚙️ Choose paper vs live trading
3. ⚙️ Set environment variables (done by script)

---

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### Development/Testing
- **Railway**: Free for ~20 days/month
- **Render**: Free (sleeps when idle)
- **Fly.io**: Free indefinitely
- **Docker**: Free (your server)

### Production (24/7 Uptime)
- **Railway**: $5-10/month
- **Render**: $7/month
- **Fly.io**: $5/month (with Redis)
- **Docker**: Server costs

### Recommendation
→ Start free on Fly.io or Railway free tier
→ Upgrade to paid when you need 24/7 uptime

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After deployment, you should see:

1. **Health Check Passing**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
   # {"status":"healthy"}
   ```

2. **Alpaca Connected**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/validate-alpaca
   # {"valid":true}
   ```

3. **Frontend Loading**
   - Open URL in browser
   - See modern dark/light theme dashboard
   - Controls responsive and working

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket connection active

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
→ Check `railway logs` or platform logs
→ Ensure all required files present
→ Verify Node.js and Python versions

### Alpaca Connection Fails
→ Verify API keys are correct
→ Check `ALPACA_BASE_URL` is set
→ Ensure API keys have trading permissions

### Redis Not Working
→ Railway: Verify Redis plugin added
→ Render: Check Redis service running
→ Fly.io: Run `flyctl redis create`

### Frontend 404
→ Check build completed successfully
→ Verify `frontend/dist` directory exists
→ Review build logs for errors
